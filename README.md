## Overview

The Onyx is a wearable "smart walkie-talkie" produced by [Orion Labs](https://www.orionlabs.io/).  This repository contains useful information for interfacing with the second generation Onyx released to the consumer market in 2016.  The Onyx unit itself is a smallish, round device with a speaker and microphone worn on a lapel.

The Onyx uses Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to communicate with a client, usually the Onyx application running on a smartphone.  No standard Bluetooth audio protocols are used.

## Progress

So far the [GATT characteristics](docs/characteristics.md) have been documented and are available for interfacing with.
